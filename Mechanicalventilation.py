Additionally, advanced ventilator management strategies, such as lung-protective ventilation techniques, prone positioning, and consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in refractory cases, may be warranted. Moreover, close collaboration between multidisciplinary teams, including critical care specialists, respiratory therapists, and physical therapists, is essential to tailor individualized management plans and provide comprehensive support for high-risk patients.")

st.markdown('The AI application was deployed based on the eXGBM model, which demonstrated superior performance compared to other models. It achieved the highest recall (0.892) and exhibited excellent results in terms of Brier score (0.088), log loss (0.291), and calibration slope (0.999). Additionally, the model ranked second in terms of area under the curve value (0.949, 95%: 0.933-0.961), accuracy (0.871), F1 score (0.873), and discrimination slope (0.647). However, it is important to note that patient treatment should not be solely based on the AI platform, and the modelâ€™s predictions should be considered in conjunction with clinical expertise and other relevant factors.')
